Example rules

See [example-rules.json](example-rules.json)

For now these have to be pased in to the extension's preferences
page in `about:addons` - Mozilla's prefences don't have a long text
entry field, so it's a single line, but pasting multi-line content
works fine. In the future it may be changed to a file you can place
anywhere to make editing rules easier.
